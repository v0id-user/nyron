# Quickstart

This guide will help you set up Nyron in your project and create your first automated release.

## Initialize Nyron

Run the initialization command to create a configuration file:

```bash
npx @nyron/cli init
```

This creates a `nyron.config.ts` file in your project root with the following structure:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@nyron/cli/config"

export default defineConfig({
  repo: "owner/repo", // Your GitHub repo
  projects: {
    sdk: {
      tagPrefix: "@my-package/sdk@",
      path: "packages/sdk",
    },
    service: {
      tagPrefix: "@my-package/service@",
      path: "apps/service",
    },
  },
  autoChangelog: true,
  onPushReminder: true,
})
```

**Edit this file** to match your project structure.

### Single-Package Repository

For a single-package repo, use this simpler configuration:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@nyron/cli/config"

export default defineConfig({
  repo: "your-org/your-repo",
  projects: {
    main: {
      tagPrefix: "v",
      path: ".",
    },
  },
  autoChangelog: true,
  onPushReminder: true,
})
```

## Setup GitHub Token (Required)

Nyron requires a GitHub token to function properly:

```bash
# Create .env in your project root
echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here" > .env
```

Generate a token at [GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and ensure you check **all** of the following permissions:

- `repo` (**Full control of private repositories**)
- `repo:status` (**Access commit status**)
- `repo_deployment` (**Access deployment status**)
- `public_repo` (**Access public repositories**)
- `repo:invite` (**Access repository invitations**)
- `security_events` (**Read and write security events**)

<Callout type="warn">
A GitHub token is required for Nyron to access repository metadata, commit information, and create releases. Be sure to select all the permissions listed above. Without the correct permissions, Nyron will not work.
</Callout>

## Understanding Nyron Tags

Nyron uses a **dual-tag system** that separates version tracking from release boundaries:

### Project Tags (Version Tracking)
- **Format**: `v1.2.0`, `@pkg/name@1.2.0` (based on your `tagPrefix` config)
- **Created by**: `nyron bump` command
- **Purpose**: Track package versions in your repository
- **Used for**: Version metadata, changelog file generation

### Nyron-Release Tags (Release Boundaries)
- **Format**: `nyron-release@2024-01-15@14-30-25.123`
- **Created by**: `nyron push-tag` or `nyron release` command
- **Purpose**: Mark release boundaries for GitHub releases
- **Used for**: Determining which commits to include in releases

<Callout type="info">
**Important**: Nyron **only** uses `nyron-release@*` tags to determine release boundaries. Your existing tags (like `v1.0.0`, `v2.0.0`, etc.) won't interfere with Nyron, but they also won't be used as release boundaries. Nyron-release tags are completely independent of your project tag prefixes.
</Callout>

## Starting with an Existing Repository

If your repository already has many commits and tags (e.g., 500+ commits with various version tags), here's how to get started:

### Step 1: Initialize Nyron

```bash
npx @nyron/cli init
```

Edit `nyron.config.ts` to match your project structure. Your existing tags won't interfere with Nyron.

### Step 2: Create Your First Nyron-Release Tag

For existing repositories, you need to establish a baseline nyron-release tag. This marks where Nyron will start tracking releases from:

```bash
# First, bump your version (if needed)
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v

# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initialize nyron"

# Create and push the first nyron-release tag
npx @nyron/cli push-tag
```

This creates your first `nyron-release@*` tag at the current HEAD. Future releases will include commits since this tag.

<Callout type="warn">
**For existing repos**: When you create your first nyron-release tag, Nyron will use all commits from that tag forward for future releases. If you want to create a release for commits that happened before this tag, you'll need to manually create a nyron-release tag at an earlier commit point first.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Create Your First Release

After pushing your first nyron-release tag, create a release:

```bash
# Use -n flag since you already pushed the tag
npx @nyron/cli release -n
```

The `-n` flag tells Nyron to use the existing nyron-release tag you just pushed, rather than creating a new one.

## Start Using Nyron

Now you're ready to use Nyron! Here's the typical workflow:

### Standard Workflow (Recommended)

This workflow uses GPG-signed tags and separates tag creation from release creation:

```bash
# 1. Bump version and auto-generate changelog
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v

# 2. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"

# 3. Create and push nyron-release tag (GPG-signed if configured)
npx @nyron/cli push-tag

# 4. Create GitHub release (use -n since tag already exists)
npx @nyron/cli release -n
```

**Why use `-n`?** The `-n` (or `--no-tag`) flag tells Nyron to use the nyron-release tag you just pushed with `push-tag`, rather than creating a duplicate tag. This is especially important when:
- You want GPG-signed tags (created locally with `push-tag`)
- You're using CI/CD workflows that trigger on tag pushes
- You've already created a nyron-release tag manually

### Simplified Workflow (Alternative)

If you don't need GPG-signed tags, you can let `release` create the tag automatically:

```bash
# 1. Bump version and auto-generate changelog
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v

# 2. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"

# 3. Create GitHub release (creates nyron-release tag automatically)
npx @nyron/cli release

# 4. Push commits and tags
git push
```

<Callout type="info">
**When to use `-n`**: Always use `-n` when you've already created a nyron-release tag (with `push-tag` or manually). Without `-n`, the `release` command will create a new nyron-release tag, which may not be what you want.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

<Callout type="warn">
**Important:** For the best experience with Nyron, configure your GitHub repository settings to enforce clean commit history and conventional commit format. See the [GitHub repository setup guide](/docs/guides/conventional-commits#github-repository-setup) for required settings.
