# How It Works

Nyron reads your Git history and parses **conventional commits** to generate structured changelogs automatically.

## The Process

Nyron follows a systematic approach to generate your changelogs:

### 1. Fetches commits

Nyron retrieves commits based on `nyron-release@*` tags, which serve as release boundaries:

- **With `-n` flag**: Fetches commits **between** the previous `nyron-release@*` tag and the latest one
- **Without `-n` flag**: Fetches commits from the latest `nyron-release@*` tag to HEAD

<Callout type="info">
**Important**: Nyron **only** uses `nyron-release@*` tags to determine release boundaries. Your project version tags (like `v1.0.0`, `@pkg/name@1.0.0`) are not used for this purpose. If you have an existing repository with many commits and tags, Nyron will only look at commits since the last `nyron-release@*` tag (or from the beginning if none exists).
</Callout>

### 2. Filters out meta commits

Version bumps, changelog updates, and other meta commits are automatically excluded from the changelog. This ensures your changelog focuses on meaningful changes rather than version management overhead.

### 3. Parses conventional commit syntax

Each commit is analyzed to extract:
- **Type**: The category of change (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- **Scope**: The area of the codebase affected (optional)
- **Message**: The description of the change

### 4. Groups commits

Commits are organized into meaningful categories:
- **Features**: New functionality
- **Bug Fixes**: Bug fixes and corrections
- **Chores**: Maintenance, documentation, refactoring

### 5. Enriches with GitHub data

If a GitHub token is configured, Nyron adds:
- Author usernames and links
- Author avatars
- Commit URLs linking to GitHub

### 6. Generates markdown

The final output is formatted as clean, readable markdown suitable for changelogs.

## Example Output

Here's what a generated changelog section looks like:

```markdown
## Features
- **auth**: add OAuth2 login ([@username](https://github.com/username)) [[a1b2c3d](https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/a1b2c3d)]

## Bug Fixes
- **api**: resolve memory leak in endpoint ([@username](https://github.com/username)) [[e4f5g6h](https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/e4f5g6h)]
```

## Understanding Release Boundaries

Nyron uses a dual-tag system:

### Project Tags (Version Tracking)
- Created by `nyron bump` command
- Format: Based on your `tagPrefix` config (e.g., `v1.2.0`, `@pkg/name@1.2.0`)
- Purpose: Track package versions in your repository
- **Not used** as release boundaries

### Nyron-Release Tags (Release Boundaries)
- Created by `nyron push-tag` or `nyron release` command
- Format: `nyron-release@2024-01-15@14-30-25.123`
- Purpose: Mark release boundaries for GitHub releases
- **Only these tags** determine which commits are included in releases

When you run `nyron release`:
1. It finds the latest `nyron-release@*` tag
2. Fetches commits since that tag (or between tags with `-n`)
3. Parses those commits to generate the changelog
4. Creates a GitHub release

<Callout type="warn">
**For existing repositories**: If you're starting with Nyron on a repo that already has many commits and tags, create an initial `nyron-release@*` tag at your desired starting point. Future releases will only include commits after that tag. Without an initial tag, Nyron will include all commits from the beginning of your repository.
</Callout>

## What Makes It Work

### Conventional Commits

Nyron relies on the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This standardized format allows Nyron to:

- Automatically categorize changes
- Generate meaningful changelogs
- Determine the scope of changes

Learn more about [conventional commits format](/docs/guides/conventional-commits).

### GitHub Integration

The GitHub integration provides rich context:

- **Author attribution**: See who made each change
- **Commit links**: Jump directly to the commit on GitHub
- **Repository metadata**: Accurate project information

While GitHub is currently required, support for other platforms is planned.

## Benefits

By automating the changelog generation process, Nyron:

- ✅ Saves time on manual changelog writing
- ✅ Ensures consistency across releases
- ✅ Reduces human error in version management
- ✅ Keeps your team focused on building features
