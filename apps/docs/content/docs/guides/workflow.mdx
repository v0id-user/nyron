# Workflow

Here's a typical end-to-end versioning workflow using Nyron, from checking changes to creating a release.

<Callout type="info">
**Understanding Release Boundaries**: Nyron uses `nyron-release@*` tags to determine which commits to include in releases. These tags are separate from your project version tags (like `v1.0.0`). When you run `release`, Nyron looks for the latest `nyron-release@*` tag and includes all commits since that tag (or between tags if using `-n`). Your existing tags won't interfere with this process.
</Callout>

## Complete Release Workflow

### Basic Workflow (Simplest)

The simplest workflow without manual tag pushing:

```bash
# 1. Bump version and generate changelog
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v

# 2. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"

# 3. Create GitHub release (this also creates the nyron-release tag)
npx @nyron/cli release

# 4. Push commits and tags
git push
```

The `release` command automatically:
- Finds the latest `nyron-release@*` tag (or uses first commit if none exists)
- Fetches commits since that tag to HEAD
- Generates a new `nyron-release@*` tag with timestamp
- Creates and pushes the tag to GitHub
- Creates the GitHub release with auto-generated changelog

<Callout type="warn">
**First-time use**: If this is your first release and no `nyron-release@*` tags exist, `release` will include all commits from the beginning of your repository history. For existing repos with many commits, consider creating an initial `nyron-release@*` tag first using `push-tag` to establish a baseline.
</Callout>

### Workflow with GPG-Signed Tags (Recommended)

If you want to GPG-sign your release tags locally before pushing:

```bash
# 1. Bump version and generate changelog
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v

# 2. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"

# 3. Create and push GPG-signed nyron-release tag
npx @nyron/cli push-tag

# 4. Create GitHub release (use -n since tag already exists)
npx @nyron/cli release -n

# 5. Push commits
git push
```

**Why use this workflow?**
- GPG signs the tag locally before pushing
- Provides cryptographic verification
- Shows "Verified" badge on GitHub
- Proves authenticity of the release
- Works seamlessly with CI/CD workflows

**Understanding the `-n` flag**: When you use `push-tag`, it creates a `nyron-release@*` tag. The `-n` flag tells `release` to use that existing tag instead of creating a duplicate. Without `-n`, `release` would create a new tag, which isn't what you want when you've already pushed one.

## Monorepo Workflow

For monorepos with multiple packages, the workflow is the same but you specify which package to release:

### Basic Monorepo Workflow

```bash
# Bump specific package
npx @nyron/cli bump --type patch --prefix @myapp/api@

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore(api): bump version to 1.0.1"

# Create release (creates nyron-release tag automatically)
npx @nyron/cli release

# Push commits and tags
git push
```

<Callout type="info">
**Monorepo note**: Even in monorepos, Nyron uses a single `nyron-release@*` tag system for release boundaries. All commits since the last `nyron-release@*` tag will be included, regardless of which package they affect. The `tagPrefix` in your config is only used for project version tags, not release boundaries.
</Callout>

### With GPG-Signed Tags

```bash
# Bump specific package
npx @nyron/cli bump --type patch --prefix @myapp/api@

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore(api): bump version to 1.0.1"

# Create GPG-signed tag
npx @nyron/cli push-tag

# Create release (skip tag creation)
npx @nyron/cli release -n

# Push commits
git push
```

## Version Bump Decision Guide

Choose the appropriate bump type based on your changes:

### Major (`--type major`)

Use for breaking changes that require users to update their code:

- API changes that break compatibility
- Removal of deprecated features
- Major architectural changes

Example: `1.5.2` → `2.0.0`

### Minor (`--type minor`)

Use for new features that are backward compatible:

- New functionality
- New API endpoints
- Feature enhancements

Example: `1.5.2` → `1.6.0`

### Patch (`--type patch`)

Use for bug fixes and minor updates:

- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Performance improvements (non-breaking)

Example: `1.5.2` → `1.5.3`

## Automated Release Workflow

You can set up a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically creates releases when you push nyron-release tags locally. This is useful for:
- GPG-signing tags locally before pushing
- Triggering automated release creation
- Separating local development from release publishing

### Setup CI/CD Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Publish Github Release Using Nyron

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'nyron-release@*'

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  publish-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history to ensure latest tag is available
      
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
        with:
          bun-version: latest

      - run: bun install
      - run: bun x @nyron/cli release -n
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

**Note:** The `-n` flag tells the release command to use the existing `nyron-release@*` tag you pushed with `push-tag`, rather than creating a duplicate tag. This is essential when using CI/CD workflows.

### Usage

When ready to release:

```bash
# 1. Bump and commit
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v
git add . && git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"

# 2. Push tag (creates GPG-signed tag and triggers the workflow)
npx @nyron/cli push-tag

# 3. Push your commits
git push

# The GitHub Actions workflow automatically creates the release! 🎉
```

### Comparison: Local vs Automated

**Local Release (No CI/CD):**
```bash
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v
git add . && git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"
npx @nyron/cli release  # Creates tag & release locally
git push
```

**Automated Release (With CI/CD):**
```bash
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v
git add . && git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"
npx @nyron/cli push-tag  # Creates GPG-signed tag, triggers CI/CD
git push  # CI/CD creates the release for you
```

**Benefits of Automated Workflow:**
- ✅ GPG-sign tags locally for verified releases
- ✅ Separate concerns (local dev vs release publishing)
- ✅ Consistent release environment
- ✅ No need to have `GITHUB_TOKEN` locally

### Customizing the Workflow

You can modify the workflow to use npm, pnpm, or Node.js instead of Bun:

```yaml
# For npm
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
- run: npm install
- run: npx @nyron/cli release

# For pnpm
- uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'pnpm'
- run: pnpm install
- run: pnpm exec @nyron/cli release
```

## Pro Tips

### Use the reminder feature

If you have `onPushReminder: true` in your config, Nyron will remind you to push your tags after creating them.

### Preview releases

You can preview what will be included in a release using the dry-run flag:

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release --dry-run
```

### Consistent commit messages

The better your commit messages follow [conventional commits](/docs/guides/conventional-commits), the better your changelog will look.

### Configure GitHub repository settings

For the best experience with Nyron, configure your GitHub repository to enforce clean commit history and conventional commit format. See the [GitHub repository setup guide](/docs/guides/conventional-commits#github-repository-setup) for detailed instructions.
