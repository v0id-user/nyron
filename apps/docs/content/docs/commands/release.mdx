# nyron release

Create GitHub releases with auto-generated changelogs based on commits between nyron-release tags.

## Usage

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release
```

### Preview changelog without creating release

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release --dry-run
```

### Skip tag creation (use existing tag)

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release -n
```

## Options

### `-d, --dry-run`

**Optional.** Preview the changelog without creating an actual GitHub release.

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release --dry-run
```

### `-n, --no-tag`

**Optional.** Skip creating a new nyron-release tag. Use this when:
- You already created a tag with `push-tag` command
- Running in CI/CD after tag was pushed locally
- You want to use a GPG-signed tag created manually

**Important**: When using `-n`, the command fetches commits BETWEEN the previous tag and the latest tag (the one you just pushed). Without `-n`, it fetches commits FROM the latest tag to HEAD.

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release -n
```

**Example: Using with push-tag**

```bash
# Create GPG-signed tag locally
npx @nyron/cli push-tag

# Create release without creating another tag
# This will use commits BETWEEN the previous tag and the tag you just pushed
npx @nyron/cli release -n
```

## How It Works

The `release` command works by:

1. **Determining which tags to use** - Finds the latest nyron-release tag (and previous tag if using `-n` flag)
2. **Fetching commits** - Gets commits between tags (with `-n`) or from latest tag to HEAD (without `-n`)
3. **Parsing conventional commits** - Extracts features, fixes, and other changes
4. **Reading version information** - Loads version data from the .nyron/ directory
5. **Generating a changelog** - Creates markdown changelog from parsed commits
6. **Creating a GitHub release** - Publishes the release with the changelog as the description
7. **Creating a new nyron-release tag** - Only when running without `-n` flag and not in dry-run mode. This tag marks the boundary for the NEXT release.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** A `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable must be set
- **Required:** At least one nyron-release tag must exist (created by `push-tag`)
- **Required:** Commits must follow [conventional commit format](/docs/guides/conventional-commits)

## What It Does

The release command:

- Creates a GitHub release on your repository
- Uses an auto-generated changelog as the release description
- Groups commits by type (Features, Bug Fixes, Chores, etc.)
- Includes author information and commit links
- **Creates a new nyron-release tag** (only without `-n` flag) - This tag is created AFTER the release and marks the boundary for the NEXT release, not the current one

### Tag Creation Behavior

- **Without `-n` flag**: Creates a new nyron-release tag AFTER the release is published. This tag marks where the NEXT release will start from.
- **With `-n` flag**: Does NOT create a new tag. Uses the existing tag you pushed with `push-tag` command.
- **Dry-run mode**: Does NOT create a tag (or release), only previews what would be created.

## Examples

### Create a release

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release
```

### Preview what will be released

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release --dry-run
```

Sample output:
```
📍 Step 1: Finding latest release tag...
✓ Found tag: nyron-release@2024-01-15@14-30-25.123

📍 Step 2: Fetching commits since last release...
✓ Found 5 commit(s)

📍 Step 3: Parsing commits...
✓ Parsed commits into groups (features, fixes, etc.)

📍 Step 4: Reading version information...
✓ Loaded version data for 2 package(s)

📍 Step 5: Generating changelog...
✓ Changelog generated (1,234 characters)

📍 Step 6: Preview (DRY RUN - no release created)
📍 Step 7: (Skipped in dry-run mode - would create new nyron-release tag)

## Typical Workflow

### Manual Workflow

The `release` command is typically used as the final step:

```bash
# 1. Bump version and generate changelog
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v

# 2. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"

# 3. Create and push nyron-release tag
npx @nyron/cli push-tag

# 4. Create GitHub release (use -n since tag already exists)
# This creates the release and does NOT create another tag
npx @nyron/cli release -n
```

**Note**: If you run `release` without `-n` after pushing a tag, it will create a duplicate tag. Always use `-n` when you've already pushed a tag with `push-tag`.

### Automated Workflow (Recommended)

Alternatively, set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run the `release` command when you push a nyron-release tag:

```bash
# 1. Bump and commit
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v
git add . && git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"

# 2. Push tag (triggers automated release)
npx @nyron/cli push-tag

# ✨ The GitHub release is created automatically by CI/CD!
```

This workflow requires a `.github/workflows/release.yml` file in your repository. See the [automated workflow guide](/docs/guides/workflow#automated-release-workflow) for setup instructions.

## Error Handling

**No nyron-release tag found:**
```
Error: No nyron release tag found
   → Make sure to push the tag with nyron tool
```
Run `npx @nyron/cli push-tag` first.

**No commits found:**
```
⚠️  No commits found between tags - skipping release
```
This means there are no new commits since the last release.

**Missing GitHub token:**
```
Error: GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is required
```
Set your GitHub token in a `.env` file or environment variable.
